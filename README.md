# Data Warehouse and Data Model Revision Project for an Online Store 

## Overview

This project focuses on restructuring the data model for an e-commerce platform to optimize analytical processing and storage efficiency. We have decomposed the extensive shipping table into logical, manageable tables and built a data mart that supports targeted queries about vendor rates, shipping costs by country, and weekly delivery metrics. This restructuring enables analysts to efficiently conduct business profitability and efficiency analyses.
